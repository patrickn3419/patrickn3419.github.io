                    <p>
                        I have always had a passion for music. I enjoy listening to music because 
                        it can convey many emotions and messages so well. I have 5 years of self taught 
                        piano experience, along with 2 years of lessons. I have around 10 months of guitar
                        experience. I also enjoy playing on the drums occasionally because I learned drums 
                        in 6th grade. I like to listen to to 90s rock, 90s hip hop, pop, classical, jazz, 
                        and electronic music. On the piano, I enjoy to compose a lot, although I haven't
                        made any full songs yet.

                    <p>
                        I have been drawing for a long time. I enjoy drawing anime the most,
                        however, I also enjoy drawing landscapes and and cartoony styles. I made raised money 
                        for my 8th grade feild trip by selling charicatures in middle school. At 
                        the end of the year, I was elected as the most artistic person in the grade. 
                        Drawing for  me is a way to just relax and let my mind rest. I mainly use either pen
                        and pencil, however I have been trying to get into painting and also using oil pastels.

                    <h1>Martial Arts</h1>
                    <p>
                        Martial arts has always been a massive part of my life. I started out doing
                        taekwondo at five years old until I took a two year break from martial arts to do soccer 
                        during first and second grade in the suberbs. Returning to Chicago I joined a Karate school
                        called Thousand Waves and I trained there for the next five years, earning my first black
                        belt. I continued to come to class for another few months and taught in the junior class.
                        I then quit to join wrestling and am still training. I believe that martial arts are so 
                        amazing because they keep your body in shape and they also teach you very important 
                        values in life.

                    <h1>Coding</h1>
                    <p>
                        I picked up coding during the lockdown of 2020. I had a lot of opportunity to experiment 
                        with coding. I originally started on Scratch.mit, and I coded short animations. I also coded 
                        simple clicker games and platformers which I enjoyed doing because it was satisfying to 
                        put the code together and see the result in the end. Then, in my 8th grade year, I was part of 
                        the Lego League robotics team in my middle school. Coding is a usefull skill to have as 
                        computers are going to start becoming more necessary in modern society. As of now, I'm 
                        taking the Web Development course at Lane tech. Coding projects that I have worked on include 
                        the collection of websites in which I showcase a recipe.
