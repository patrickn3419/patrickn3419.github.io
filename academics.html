                    <h1>Academic Acheivments</h1>
                    <p>
                        I have always excelled in the academics of my school. The most tricky part about
                        academics is being able to balance in extracurriculars like sports and other learning
                        out side of school along with free-time and sleep. However, I have managed to mantain 
                        a steady balance with my academics, even after joining wrestling in the fall. I believe 
                        that time management is one of the most important things that a person can learn. It 
                        helps a lot to have a structure to my day, and being organized allows me to get the most
                        important work done at the right times so I never miss a deadline. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some of my favorite subjects are reading, math, mandarin, and web Development. I like reading because when I write essays, 
                        I enjoy building an essay from scratch and watching as it unfolds. I like math because 
                        I pick up concepts realatively quickly, and I put them to use well. I like mandarin because
                        learning a language is fascinating to me. I like web development, or any other computer
                        science class because it is really easy to pick up and understand, and it can be built upon 
                        really easily.

                    <p>
                        I have reaserched colleges only to an extent. I know that the most important things for me 
                        when looking for a college are the quality of the academic programs there, especially compurter
                        science, the feel of the campus, the student experience, and the quality of the professors. I also
                        think that studying abroad may be a fun idea. If I could study abroad, I would want to go to Japan 
                        or China. Currently, my number one pick for college is MIT, because it's computer science programs 
                        is considered one of the bests in the world, and the campus is nice. Feilds I would like to go into 
                        are robotics, artificial intelligence, and web development.
